# org.allseen.LSF.LampService version 1

## Important Note
This interface has been defined prior to the creation of the interface design guidelines for AllSeen.
Many design decisions in this interface do not comply with the guidelines and constitute bad precedent.
Do not use these interfaces as a template to define your own: they will not pass IRB review.

The latest version of the IRB guidelines can be found on the
[IRB wiki pages](https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/interfacereviewboard).

For a detailed annotation of the interface design guideline violations in this interface, please
visit the [Gerrit submission page](https://git.allseenalliance.org/gerrit/#/c/5877/).

## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Lamp Service to enable the LSF Lamp
Clients to fetch the version of the Lamp Service and also to get/reset a
Lamp Fault.

The interface is not secure.

### Methods

#### ClearLampFault (LampFaultCode) -> (LampResponseCode, LampFaultCode)

This method allows the LSF Lamp Clients to clear a Lamp Fault. 

Input arguments: 

  * **LampFaultCode** --- uint16 --- the code associated with a Lamp Fault to be cleared.

Output arguments:

  * **LampResponseCode** --- uint16 --- the response code indicating the status of the operation. The list of valid
    values are:

| Value | Description                                                       		|
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Success status                                                   		|
| 1     | Unexpected NULL pointer encountered internally                                |
| 2     | An operation was unexpected at this time                          		|
| 4     | A unknown value                                                   		|
| 5     | A failure has occurred                                            		|
| 6     | An operation failed and should be retried later                   		|
| 7     | The request was rejected                                          		|

  * **LampFaultCode** --- uint16 --- the code associated with a Lamp Fault to be cleared.
