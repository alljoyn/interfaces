# org.allseen.LSF.LampState version 1


## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Lamp Service to enable the LSF Lamp
Clients to access and control the state of a Lamp.

Lamp State is the state information that the Lamp persists through reset or power 
cycle that includes End-User set state attributes such as Hue, Saturation, Color Temperature, 
and Brightness.

The interface is not secure.
