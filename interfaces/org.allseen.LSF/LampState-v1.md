# org.allseen.LSF.LampState version 1

## Important Note
This interface has been defined prior to the creation of the interface design guidelines for AllSeen.
Many design decisions in this interface do not comply to the guidelines and constitute bad precedent.
Do not use these interfaces as a template to define your own: they will not pass IRB review.

The latest version of the IRB guidelines can be found on the
[IRB wiki pages](https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/interfacereviewboard).

For a detailed annotation of the interface design guideline violations in this interface, please
visit the [Gerrit submission page](https://git.allseenalliance.org/gerrit/#/c/5877/).

## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Lamp Service to enable the LSF Lamp
Clients to access and control the state of a Lamp.

Lamp State is the state information that the Lamp persists through reset or power 
cycle that includes End-User set state attributes such as Hue, Saturation, Color Temperature, 
and Brightness. We need to persist the state to ensure that the Lamp comes back ON at the
same state that it was it before the power cycle/reset.

The interface is not secure.

### Methods

#### TransitionLampState (Timestamp, NewState, TransitionPeriod) -> (LampResponseCode)

This method allows the LSF Lamp Clients to transition the state of a lamp. 

Input arguments: 

  * **Timestamp** --- uint64 --- the timestamp to start the transition at.
  * **NewState** --- key-value pairs --- the new state to transition to. The keys are the property names in the [LampState interface](LampState-v1.xml) interface.
  * **TransitionPeriod** --- uint16 --- the transition period in milliseconds.

Output arguments:

  * **LampResponseCode** --- uint16 --- the response code indicating the status of the operation. The list of valid
    values are:
