# org.alljoyn.BulkDataTrasfer.FirmwareSelection version 1


## Theory of Operation

This interface defines the means for a device to retrieve a firmware update
image.  There are 2 roles in the firmware update process: the firmware update
provider and the device to be updated.

While the typical AllJoyn service is generally implemented as one or more bus
objects on a device that announce their presence using the About feature and
hosts sessions that are joined by clients, the Firmware Update service operates
differently to keep the number of open sessions to an absolute minimum.

For the Firmware Update service, devices that support firmware updates via
AllJoyn will announce this capability by adding a special entry to the About
data dictionary.  The key will be "AllJoynFirmwareUpdate".  The value will be a
struct containing a session port number and a list of firmwareIds.  A firmwareId
is the SHA-256 hash of the firmware image and is formatted as an array of bytes
in both the About data and in this interface.  In other words, the value
signature will be "(qaay)".

Devices that support updating their firmware via AllJoyn must host a session that
Firmware update providers can join for firmware update delivery.

Firmware update providers will monitor About messages for devices that include
the AllJoynFirmwareUpdate entry in their About data.  The firmware update
providers will keep track of the firmwareIds along with the associated devices
and their session port numbers.

When a firmware update provider gets a firmware update image for one of the
firmwareIds it is tracking, it will join a session at the specified session port
for each device that is running that firmwareId.  Once the session is
established, the firmware update provider will send the UpdateAvailable signal
to inform the device about the availability of the firmware update image.

When a device supporting firmware updates via AllJoyn gets an UpdateAvailable
signal, it will call the OpenUpdate method with the firmwareId to be updated.
Note that the UpdateAvailable signal is a sessioncast signal and not sessionless
signal.  This ensures that the device to be updated gets the signal when the
firmware update provider is ready to deliver the update to that device.  The
device does not need to make the OpenUpdate method call immediately, it may wait
until a convenient time to perform the update.  It should be noted that the
"push" model of delivering firmware updates is effectively replicated when a
device does respond immediately to the UpdateAvailable signal by calling
OpenUpdate.  After the device receives the response with the bus object path for
the object containing the updated firmware image, the device may then proceed to
download the firmware image using the org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Get interface
on that bus object.  The device may use the Sha256Hash property from the
org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Information interface to verify the download was
successful.

The approach of having the firmware update provider join the session keeps
resource utilization to a minimum.  If a more traditional approach were to be
taken, then the firmware update provider would need to keep sessions to possibly
hundreds of devices alive for a long time in the rare event that an update
becomes available.  For TCP sessions, this means keeping the TCP connection open
and alive.  This could negatively impact low power devices as well as the costs
associated with keeping long lived TCP connection alive on the firmware update
provider.  Using About to announce new firmware versions would mean devices
would need to parse About messages more frequently, often times for firmware
updates that don't apply to them.  The approach described above reduces the
number of changes to the About contents and allows the firmware update provider
control of how many devices it will update at a time.  Also, sessions between the
firmware update provider and devices are only in use for the actual firmware
update data transfer.

Note that all bus objects created by this interface will only implement
org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Get and org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Information.
This means there are no contention problems that would arise if the
org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Put interface were to be implemented as well.  If a
firmware update provider were to implement some other data/media/file discovery
and selection interface as well, it is recommended that bus objects created by
that interface not interfere or interact in any way with bus objects created
during the use of this interface.

While this theory of operation has discussed the 2 roles of firmware image
provider and device being updated, this interface can actually be used implement
a hierarchy of firmware image providers.  This divides the firmware image
providers into 2 categories: update brokers and canonical firmware image
provider.  An update broker is generally a "middleman" who gets firmware updates
from a canonical firmware image provider and delivers that image to devices on
the local network.  A canonical firmware image provider hosts all relevant
versions of firmware images for a given set of devices.

A canonical firmware image provider will likely be publicly accessible service
on the Internet.  As such, it may not support AllJoyn for communications.  Thus
update brokers will (often) need to be written to support the communication
protocol used by canonical firmware image providers found on the Internet.

Because canonical firmware image providers host all versions of a firmware
codebase for a given device, it will also need to keep track of which version
replace(s) which other version(s).  While updating from one version to the next
may appear to be a simple chain, from the image provider's perspective it will
actually resemble a tree given that some updates may be able to skip over
versions.

While update brokers will typically download an cache firmware updates for local
distribution, it is not strictly required that update brokers do so.  It is
possible to implement an update broker that is simply a data relay or bridge to
a different firmware update distribution protocol.

Update brokers that do cache firmware images can use the information from the
device's About announcements to determine if all devices have been successfully
updated or not.  If all devices are updated, then the update brokers can remove
the image from its cache.  If another device joins the network that needs an
update that was flushed from the cache, the update broker will need to
re-download the update image again.

### Possible update broker design examples

#### Home gateway/router

An update broker implemented in a home gateway/router device could be fully
autonomous.  It would monitor About messages from devices on the home network
along with canonical firmware image providers.  When it finds an updated
firmware image for one of the devices on the home network, it downloads that
image from the canonical image provider, caches it locally, then distributes it
to the relevant devices on the home network.

#### Corporate IT

An update broker implemented for corporate environments would still monitor
About messages and canonical image providers for updates.  Instead of automatic
download and distribution, it would notify IT staff.  IT staff could then direct
the update broker to update only test device to allow the IT staff to vet the
update.  Once the IT staff vetted the update, they can then direct the update
broker to distribute the update company wide on a schedule of their choosing.

A corporate update broker may also cache many versions of firmware images and
act as a pseudo-canonical firmware image provider.  It could even provide a
means for IT do rollback an update by rearranging the tree that describes which
version updates which other versions.

#### Friendly neighbor device

Another possibility would be for a device that gets updated to also include
limited update broker functionality.  If a device keeps track of the SHA-256
hashes of the preceding firmware versions for the version it is currently
running, then that device could update its neighbors with its own version.

(Note that this might be in conflict with the needs of a corporate environment.)

### Properties

This interface does not define any properties.


### Methods

#### OpenUpdate(firmwareId) -> (busObjectPath)

This creates a new bus object from which a device can download the updated
firmware image.  If multiple devices call this method with the same firmwareId,
the same busObjectPath will be returned.  Each time a given firmware update
image is opened, the firmware image provider will reference count the open
operations so that it does not remove the bus object until all devices have
completed retrieving the updated image.

Input arguments:

  * **firmwareId** --- byte[] --- A 32 byte array containing the SHA-256 hash of
    the _currently_ running firmware.

Output arguments:

  * **busObjectPath** --- object_path --- The object path to the bus object
    implementing the org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Get interface

Errors raised by this method:

  * **org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Error.NotFound** --- This indicates that
    either the firmwareId is not known or that there is no update for the given
    firmwareId.


#### CloseUpdate(busObjectPath)

This lets the firmware image provider know that the device no longer needs
access to the updated firmware image.  It is strongly recommended that devices
call this prior to leaving the session rather than just leaving the session.  If
busObjectPath is invalid, it will be silently ignored.  The firmware image
provider will keep track of which firmware images were opened on which sessions
and behave as though this method was called in the event that the session is
severed unexpectedly.  Once all devices have closed their access to a firmware
udpate bus object, the bus object will be removed from the system.

Input arguments:

  * **busObjectPath** --- object_path --- The object path to the bus object
    implementing the org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Get interface

Output arguments:

_None_

Errors raised by this method:

_None_


### Signals

#### UpdateAvailable(firmwareId)

|                       |                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Signal Type           | sessioncast                       |

This signal informs a device that there is an updated firmware image available
for download.  The firmwareId is provided so that the device knows which
firmware has an update for those devices that have different firmware images for
different subsystems.

Output arguments:

  * **firmwareId** --- byte[] --- A 32 byte array containing the SHA-256 hash of
    the firmware image to be replaced by the update.


### Interface Errors

The method calls in this interface use the AllJoyn error message handling feature
(`ER_BUS_REPLY_IS_ERROR_MESSAGE`) to set the error name and error message. The table
below lists the possible errors raised by this interface.

| Error name                                  | Error message             |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Error.NotFound | firmwareId not known or has no update available. |
