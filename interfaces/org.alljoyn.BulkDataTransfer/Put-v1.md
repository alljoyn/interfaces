# org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.Put version 1

## Theory of Operation

This interface defines the Put operation for Bulk Data Transfer.  It will be
implemented on a bus object representing media/files of a predetermined size
that will be written by client applications.

When a client wishes to append data to what a server stores, it should simply
use the Put method with **startOffset** set to the same value as the **size**
property from the Information interface.  Actually, any Put operation where the
size of **dataSegment** plus **startOffset** exceeds the value in the **size**
property will cause new data to be appended.

There may be cases where the size of the data stored by the server cannot be
changed or is somehow limited to either a maximum size, a minimum size, or both.
In the case of a maximum size limit **startOffset** plus the size of
**dataSegment** exceeds the maximum size, the server will ignore excess data at
the end of **dataSegment** once the stored data has reached the maximum size.
In that case the returned size will reflect the actual amount of data stored.
If **startOffset** has the same value as the maximum data size then none of the
data in **dataSegment** will be stored and the returned size will be 0.

Attempts to truncate the data size to a size below the minimum, will silently be
ignored.

The behavior of a server in the event of an unexpected lost session (session was
lost before client called the Close method) will largely be implementation
dependent.  For example a data logger will most likely want to keep the data
received when the session was lost since there may be a clue in the logs as to
why the session was lost.  On the other hand, the data being written may be an
executable program that is completely useless if it was not completely
transferred.

### Properties

This interface does not define any properties.


### Methods

#### Put(startOffset, dataSegment) -> (size)

This sends a block of data to the server starting at the position
indicated by startOffset.

Input arguments:

  * **startOffset** --- uint64 --- The starting position within the media/file
    for the block of data to be written at.  **startOffset** may have any value
    between 0 and the value in the **size** property of the Information
    interface.
  * **dataSegment** --- byte[] --- The block of data to write.

Output arguments:

  * **size** --- uint32 --- The number of bytes actually written.
    This cannot be greater than the size of dataSegment but may be
    less if the server could not write the complete contents of
    dataSegment for whatever reason.

Errors raised by this method:

 * org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.EndOfData --- **startOffset** is past the end of
   data (i.e. **startOffset** is greater than the value in the size property
   from the Information interface).

#### Truncate(newSize)

This trims the media/file to the specified size.

Input arguments:

  * **newSize** --- uint64 --- New size of the media/file.  Must be
    less than or equal to the current size prior to calling this
    method.

Errors raised by this method:

 * org.alljoyn.BulkDataTransfer.EndOfData --- **newSize** is past the end of
   data (i.e. **newSize** is greater than the value in the size property from
   the Information interface).


### Signals

This interface does not define any signals.
