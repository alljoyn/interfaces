# org.allseen.LSF.ControllerService.PulseEffect version 1


## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Controller Service to enable the LSF Controller
Clients to create, update, delete, look up and apply Pulse Effects on Lamps.

The Pulse Effect brightens and then dims a Lamp or Lamp Group set to a predefined hue, 
saturation, or color temperature at a defined duty cycle (ratio between pulse duration 
in milliseconds and period in milliseconds).

The Controller Service can store only a certian maximum number of Pulse Effects or until the size of the 
persisted Pulse Effects file reaches a certian specified value whichever occurs first. If the user attempts to create more 
than the allowed number of Pulse Effects, "no slot for new entry" is returned as the responseCode or if the user tries to
create a new Pulse Effect after the size of the Pulse Effect file reaches the maximum allowed value, "Not enough resources" is
returned as the responseCode. These maximum values are dictated by the product that implements this interface.

The interface is not secure.
