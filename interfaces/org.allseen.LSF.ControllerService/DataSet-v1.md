### Methods

#### GetLampDataSet (lampID, language) -> (responseCode, lampID, language, lampName, lampDetails, lampState, lampParameters)

This method allows the LSF Controller Clients to fetch all the Lamp metadata. 

Input arguments:

  * **lampID** --- string --- the unique identifier of the Lamp.
  * **language** --- string --- the language associated with the Lamp Name.

Output arguments:

  * **responseCode** --- uint16 --- the response code indicating the status of the operation. The list of valid
    values are:
