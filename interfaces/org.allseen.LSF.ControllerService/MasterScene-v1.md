# org.allseen.LSF.ControllerService.MasterScene version 1

## Important Note
This interface has been defined prior to the creation of the interface design guidelines for AllSeen.
Many design decisions in this interface do not comply to the guidelines and constitute bad precedent.
Do not use these interfaces as a template to define your own: they will not pass IRB review.

The latest version of the IRB guidelines can be found on the
[IRB wiki pages](https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/interfacereviewboard).

For a detailed annotation of the interface design guideline violations in this interface, please
visit the [Gerrit submission page](https://git.allseenalliance.org/gerrit/#/c/5877/).

## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Controller Service to enable the LSF Controller
Clients to create, update, delete, look up and apply MasterScenes on Lamps.

A Master Scene consists of a list of Scenes. Scenes are preferences saved by the End User 
to set a particular mood or to simply store a setting for convenience and future recall.  
Scenes are implemented in the Controller Service and are made up of a Preset and/or Effects 
applied to a set of Lamps and/or LampGroups.

The interface is not secure.
