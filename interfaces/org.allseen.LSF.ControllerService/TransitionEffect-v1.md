# org.allseen.LSF.ControllerService.TransitionEffect version 1

## Important Note
This interface has been defined prior to the creation of the interface design guidelines for AllSeen.
Many design decisions in this interface do not comply to the guidelines and constitute bad precedent.
Do not use these interfaces as a template to define your own: they will not pass IRB review.

The latest version of the IRB guidelines can be found on the
[IRB wiki pages](https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/interfacereviewboard).

For a detailed annotation of the interface design guideline violations in this interface, please

## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Controller Service to enable the LSF Controller
Clients to create, update, delete, look up and apply Transition Effects on Lamps.

A Transition Effect transitions a Lamp or Lamp Group from its current state to a 
target state over a specified number of milliseconds.   For a Hue, Saturation, 
Color Temperature or Brightness, the transition is linear in the HSV color model.  

The Controller Service can store only a certian maximum number of Transition Effects or until the size of the 
persisted Transition Effects file reaches a certian specified value whichever occurs first. If the user attempts to create more 
than the allowed number of Transition Effects, "no slot for new entry" is returned as the responseCode or if the user tries to
create a new Transition Effect after the size of the Transition Effect file reaches the maximum allowed value, "Not enough resources" is
returned as the responseCode. These maximum values are dictated by the product that implements this interface.

The interface is not secure.
