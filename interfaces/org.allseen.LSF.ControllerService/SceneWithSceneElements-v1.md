# org.allseen.LSF.ControllerService.SceneWithSceneElements version 1


## Theory of Operation
The interface is provided by the LSF Controller Service to enable the LSF Controller
Clients to create, update and lookup Scene with Scene with Scene Elements.

The interface is not secure.

### Methods

#### CreateSceneWithSceneElements (sceneElementIDs, sceneName, language) -> (responseCode, sceneID)

This method allows the LSF Controller Clients to create a Scene with Scene Elements.
