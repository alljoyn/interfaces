# org.allseen.LSF.ControllerService.SceneWithSceneElements version 1


## Theory of Operation
This interface is provided by the LSF Controller Service to enable the LSF Controller
Clients to create, update and look up Scene with Scene with Scene Elements.

A Scene with Scene Elements consists of a list of Scene Elements that constitute the
Scene.

A Scene Element consists of a list of Lamps and Lamp Groups and an associated Effect ID
of the effect that is applied to the Lamps and Lamp Groups in the SceneElement when the
Scene Element is applied. The effect is either a Transition Effect, Pulse Effect or Preset.

A Pulse Effect brightens and then dims a Lamp or Lamp Group set to a predefined hue, 
saturation, or color temperature at a defined duty cycle (ratio between pulse duration 
in milliseconds and period in milliseconds).

A Transition Effect transitions a Lamp or Lamp Group from its current state to a 
target state over a specified number of milliseconds.   For a Hue, Saturation, 
Color Temperature or Brightness, the transition is linear in the HSV color model.  

A Preset is a user-specified Lamp State that is stored in the Controller Service.

The Controller Service can store only a maximum of 100 Scenes or until the size of the 
persisted Scenes file reaches 127KB whichever occurs first. If the user attempts to create more 
than 100 Scenes, "no slot for new entry" is returned as the responseCode or if the user tries to
create a new Scene after the size of the Scenes file reaches 127KB, "Not enough resources" is
returned as the responseCode. 

The interface is not secure.

### Methods

#### CreateSceneWithSceneElements (sceneElementIDs, sceneName, language) -> (responseCode, sceneID)

This method allows the LSF Controller Clients to create a Scene with Scene Elements. 

Input arguments:

  * **sceneElementIDs** --- string[] --- list of Scene Element IDs.
  * **sceneName** --- string --- the name of the Scene. The max supported size is 256 bytes.
  * **language** --- string --- the language tag associated with the Scene Name.

Output arguments:

  * **responseCode** --- uint16 --- the response code indicating the status of the operation. The list of valid
    values are:

| Value | Description                                                       		|
