# org.alljoyn.Onboarding version 1

## Important Note

This interface has been defined prior to the creation of the interface design
guidelines for AllSeen. Many design decisions in this interface do not comply
with the guidelines and constitute bad precedent. Do not use these interfaces as
a template to define your own: they will not pass IRB review.

The latest version of the IRB guidelines can be found on the
[IRB wiki][irb_wiki].

For a detailed annotation of the interface design guideline violations in this
interface, please visit the [Gerrit submission page][gerrit_change].

## Theory of Operation

The Onboarding service provides a common and simple way for new device to be
brought onto the AllJoyn&trade; network. This is especially useful for devices
that have a limited user interface, like a SmartPlug.

Onboarding currently supports Wi-Fi only, though the system can evolve to
leverage additional protocols (like BTLE) as they become more prevalent in this
class of devices.

### How Does it Work?

The org.alljoyn.Onboarding interface is implemented by an application on a
target device, referred to as an onboardee. A typical onboardee is an
AllJoyn&trade; thin client device. This interface allows the onboarder to send a
set of network ID and credentials to the onboardee to allow it to join a target
network.

| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = false |

The configuration state.  Possible values:

  * 0 --- Personal AP Not Configured
  * 1 --- Personal AP Configured/Not Validated
  * 2 --- Personal AP Configured/Validating
  * 3 --- Personal AP Configured/Validated
  * 4 --- Personal AP Configured/Error
  * 5 --- Personal AP Configured/Retry

#### LastError

|            |                                                          |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Type       | [`LastErrorStruct`][error_type]                          |
| Access     | read-only                                                |
| Annotation | org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal = false |

The last error code and error message. Error_message is the error message
received from the underlying Wi-Fi layer.  Possible error codes:

  * 0 --- Validated
  * 1 --- Unreachable
  * 2 --- Unsupported protocol
  * 3 --- Unauthorized
  * 4 --- Error message

### Methods

#### ConfigureWiFi(SSID, passphrase, authType) -> status

Sends the personal AP information to the onboardee. When the authType is equal
to -1 (any), the onboardee must try out all the possible authentication types it
supports to connect to the personal AP.

Input arguments:

  * **SSID** --- `string` --- Access point SSID.
  * **passphrase** --- `string` --- Access point passphrase.
  * **authType** --- `int16` --- Authentication type.  Possible values:
    * -3 --- WPA2 Auto
    * -2 --- WPA Auto
    * -1 --- Any
    *  0 --- Open
    *  1 --- WEP
    *  2 --- WPA TKIP
    *  3 --- WPA CCMP
    *  4 --- WPA2 TKIP
    *  5 --- WPA2 CCMP
    *  6 --- WPS

Output arguments:

  * **status** --- `int16` --- Response status.  Possible values:
    * 1 --- Current SoftAP mode will be disabled upon receipt of Connect. In
      this case, the Onboarder application must wait for the device to connect
      on the personal AP and query the State and LastError properties.
    * 2 --- Concurrent step used to validate the personal AP connection. In this
      case, the Onboarder application must wait for the ConnectionResult signal
      to arrive over the AllJoyn session established over the SoftAP link.

Errors raised by this method:

  * org.alljoyn.Error.OutOfRange --- Returned in the AllJoyn method call reply
    if authType parameter is invalid.

#### Connect()

Tells the onboardee to connect to the personal AP. It is recommended that the
onboardee use the concurrency feature, if it is available.

Input arguments:

_None_

Output arguments:

_None_

Errors raised by this method:

_None_

#### Offboard()

Tells the onboardee to disconnect from the personal AP, clear the personal AP
configuration fields, and start the soft AP mode.

Input arguments:

_None_

Output arguments:

_None_

Errors raised by this method:

_None_

#### GetScanInfo() -> (age, scanList)

Scans all the Wi-Fi access points in the onboardee's proximity.

Input arguments:

_None_

Output arguments:

  * **age** --- `uint16` --- Duration in minutes since last network scan was
    performed.
  * **scanList** --- [`ScanListStruct[]`][scan_type] --- List of network IDs and
    their corresponding authentication types.

Errors raised by this method:

  * org.alljoyn.Error.FeatureNotAvailable --- Returned in the AllJoyn response
    if the device does not support this feature.

### Signals

#### ConnectionResult&sup1; -> (resultCode, resultsMessage)

|             |             |
|:------------|:------------|
| Signal Type | sessioncast |

&sup1; &ndash; This signal does not follow IRB naming guidelines. Do not use
this as precedent.

This signal is emitted when the connection attempt against the personal AP is
completed. The signal is sent over the AllJoyn session established over the
SoftAP link.

This signal will only be emitted if the onboardee supports concurrent radio
connections (a.k.a., fast channel switching), so it can switch back to the
SoftAP to emit this signal to the onboarder.


Output arguments:

  * **resultCode** --- `int16` --- Connection result code.  Possible values are:
    * 0 --- Validated
    * 1 --- Unreachable
    * 2 --- Unsupported protocol
    * 3 --- Unauthorized
    * 4 --- Error message
  * **resultMessage** --- `string` --- Text that describes the connection
    result.

### Named Types

#### struct LastErrorStruct

The last error code and error message received from the underlying Wi-Fi layer.

  * **errorNumber** --- `int16` --- Error number.
  * **errorString** --- `string` --- Error message string.

#### struct ScanListStruct

Access point SSID and Auth Type.

  * **ssid** --- `string` --- Access point SSID.
  * **authType** --- `int16` ---  Access point authentication scheme:
    *  0 --- Open
    *  1 --- WEP
    *  2 --- WPA TKIP
    *  3 --- WPA CCMP
    *  4 --- WPA2 TKIP
    *  5 --- WPA2 CCMP
    *  6 --- WPS

### Interface Errors

| Error name                            | Error message                  |
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| org.alljoyn.Error.OutOfRange          | authType parameter is invalid. |
| org.alljoyn.Error.FeatureNotAvailable | Feature not supported.         |
